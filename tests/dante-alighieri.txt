My lungs were pumping as if they could not stop;\nI thought I could not go on, and I sat exhausted\nthe instant I had clambered to the top.\n\n"Up on your feet! This is no time to tire!"\nmy Master cried. "The man who lies asleep\nwill never waken fame, and his desire\n\nand all his life drift past him like a dream,\nand the traces of his memory fade from time\nlike smoke in air, or ripples on a stream.\n\nNow therefore, rise. Control your breath, and call\nupon the strength of soul that wins all battles\nunless it sink in the gross body's fall.\n\nThere is a longer ladder yet to climb:\nthis much is not enough. If you understand me,\nshow that you mean to profit from your time."
