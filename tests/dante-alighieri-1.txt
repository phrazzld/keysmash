If all that I have said of her below\nwere gathered now into a single paean\nthat would be scant praise of her beauty now.\n\nThe beauty I saw there transcends all measure\nof mortal minds. I think only her Maker\ncan wholly comprehend so great a treasure.\n\nHere I concede defeat. No poet known,\ncomic or tragic, challenged by his theme\nto show his power, was ever more outdone.\n\nAs feeblest eyes, struck by the sun, go blind,\nso the remembrance of my lady's smile\nstrikes every recognition from my mind.\n\nFrom the first day I looked upon her face\nin this life, to this present sight of her,\nmy song has followed her to sing her praise.\n\nBut here I must no longer even try\nto walk behind her beauty. Every artist,\nhis utmost done, must put his brushes by.\n\nSo do I leave her to a clarion\nof greater note than mine, which starts to draw\nits long and arduous theme to a conclusion.
